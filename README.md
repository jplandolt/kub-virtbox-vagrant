This project sets up a local Kubernetes cluster using Vagrant and VirtualBox. It creates two Ubuntu 24.04 virtual machines: one control plane node and one worker node with automatic installation of Docker, Kubernetes components, and necessary configurations.

## 🖥 Cluster Configuration

> **Note about IP Addressing**: This configuration uses `192.168.63.11` and `192.168.63.12` for the control plane and worker nodes respectively. You can modify these IPs in the `Vagrantfile` to use any IP addresses from your router's IP range that are outside the DHCP scope. Make sure to choose IPs that won't conflict with other devices on your network.

## Quick Start

> **💡 Tip**: Before starting, you may want to adjust the IP addresses in the `Vagrantfile` if the default IPs (`192.168.63.11, 192.168.63.12`) conflict with your network setup. Edit the `private_network` IP settings in the Vagrantfile to match your network requirements.

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vagrant
```

2. Start the cluster:
```bash
vagrant up
```

3. SSH into the control plane node:
```bash
vagrant ssh cplane
```

4. SSH into the worker node:
```bash
vagrant ssh worker
```

5. Stop the cluster:
```bash
vagrant halt
```

6. Destroy the cluster:
```bash
vagrant destroy
```

## Cluster Setup Instructions

After the VMs are up and running, follow these steps to initialize your Kubernetes cluster:

### 1. On Control Plane Node

First, log into the control plane node:
```bash
vagrant ssh cplane
```

Pull required Kubernetes images:
```bash
sudo kubeadm config images pull
```

Initialize the cluster:
```bash
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16 --apiserver-advertise-address=192.168.63.11
```

### 2a. Install Weave CNI (Container Network Interface)

After the cluster initialization, install Weave CNI:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/releases/download/v2.8.1/weave-daemonset-k8s.yaml
```

### NOTE: Weave CNI has been discontinued

With the shutdown of Weaveworks, Weave CNI has been effectively discontinued, the GitHub repo archived in June 2024. So a new CNI should be considered, and the first suggestion is Flannel

### 2b. Install Flannel CNI (Container Network Interface)

First, install Flannel CNI:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flannel-io/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml 
```

Then, restart the Kublet service:
```bash
sudo service kubelet restart
```

### NOTE: Control Plane script 'cluster_init.sh' wraps steps 1. and 2.

For ease of use, a single script `cluster_init.sh` was created as a function of the "vagrant up" command for the control plane(s) that performs all of the above steps:
* k8s image pull
* kubeadm init
* local copy of "kube config"
* Weave CNI install

and can be run with the vagrant command:
```bash
vagrant ssh cplane -c "./cluster_init.sh"
```

### 3. Join Worker Node

Copy the `kubeadm join` command from the control plane node's initialization output and run it on the worker node with sudo privileges.

### NOTE: Control Plane script 'join_cmd.sh' shows the 'join' command

For ease of use, script `join_cmd.sh` was created to display the join command for use on worker nodes with this vagrant command:
```bash
vagrant ssh cplane -c "./join_cmd.sh"
```

### 4. Verify Cluster Status

After joining the worker node, verify the cluster status from the control plane node:

```bash
# Check node status
kubectl get nodes
```

Expected output (it may take a few minutes for the nodes to be ready):
```
NAME     STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
cplane   Ready    control-plane   5m32s   v1.30.x
worker   Ready    <none>          2m14s   v1.30.x
```

> **Note**: The nodes may show `NotReady` status initially as the CNI (Container Network Interface) is being configured. Please wait a few minutes for the status to change to `Ready`.

### 5. (Optional) Set Role for Worker Node(s)

As the output above shows, there is no initial role set for worker nodes.  You can set their role to "worker" with:

The Kubernetes Dashboard is Web UI that allows you to manage your cluster; configure and manage aspects of the system, troubleshoot, and to have an overview of applications running on your cluster

```bash
vagrant ssh cplane -c "./set_worker_role.sh"
```

This script can be run any time a new node is added.

### 6. (Optional) Kubernetes Dashboard Installation

The Kubernetes Dashboard is Web UI that allows you to manage your cluster; configure and manage aspects of the system, troubleshoot, and to have an overview of applications running on your cluster

First, log into the control plane node:
```bash
vagrant ssh cplane
```

Execute the Dashboard setup script:
```bash
./kub_dashboard.sh <option>
```

Where `<option>` is one of:
* worker - to deploy dashboard on any worker node
* cplane - to deploy dashboard on the control plane
* token  - to show the dashboard credentials token (and the dashboard url)

Normally, the Kubernetes Dashboard would be deployed to one of the worker nodes.  This would always be the case in a production
Kubernetes cluster.  However for a small development cluster, it doesn't hurt to run the dashboard on the control plane

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while joining the worker node, try these steps on both nodes:

1. Reset the cluster configuration:
```bash
sudo kubeadm reset
```

2. Perform system cleanup:
```bash
sudo swapoff -a
sudo systemctl restart kubelet
sudo iptables -F
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/cni/
sudo systemctl restart containerd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

3. After cleanup, retry the cluster initialization on the cplane and join command on worker.
